# Improved Sampling Algorithms for Statistical Physics
In this capstone project, I implemented the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for the Ising model and for the Potts model. I also created functions for a modified version of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm that incorporates a technique known as **landscape modification** developed by Professor Michael Choi. His paper directly relevant to these implementations can be found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09680.

# Acknowledgements
The code for my implementation, in particular the functions to generate random lattice configurations and calculate the configuration energy for the Ising model, is modified from work by Tanya Schlusser on GitHub. The reference code can be referred to here: https://tanyaschlusser.github.io/posts/mcmcand-the-ising-model/.
